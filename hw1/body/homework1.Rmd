### Question 3

The objective of this question is to give practice with creating code chunks, calculator computation, and using basic functions.

#### (a)

Use R to compute the following quantities. Include parentheses to clarify the order of operations.

(i) $\dfrac{6^8}{16^5}$
```{r}

```

(ii) $101^{-\frac{8}{7}}$
```{r}

```
(iii) $8 + 3 * \pi - 3 + 4 / 2 * -1$
```{r}

```

Use the built-in functions in R to compute the following quantities.

(i) $\log_2 54$

```{r}

```

(ii) $e^{e^{\sqrt{2}}}$

```{r}

```

(iii) $\dfrac{e^\pi + e^{-\pi}}{2}$

```{r}

```

#### (c)

(i) Find the number of times that 25 goes into 119.

```{r}

```

(ii) Find the remainder after dividing 119 by 25.

```{r}

```

### Question 4

The objective of this question is to give practice with object assignment and writing a function with one argument.

Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius $r$ is $V = \dfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.

#### (a)

(i) Find the volume of a sphere of radius $r = 1$. Store the output as an object called `vol_1`.

```{r}

```

(ii) Find the volume of a sphere of radius $r = 4$. Store the output as an object called `vol_4`.

```{r}

```

#### (b)

Write a function called `vol_sphere()` that inputs an argument `r` and outputs the volume of a sphere of radius `r`. Set the default of `r` to be 1.

```{r}
vol_sphere <- function() {
  
}
```

#### (c)

(i) Verify that the command `vol_sphere()` (i.e., calling the function without changing the default argument) computes the same value as `vol_1`.

```{r}

```

(ii) Use the `vol_sphere()` function to compute the volume of a sphere of radius $4$, and verify that the result is the same value as `vol_4`.

```{r}

```

### Question 5

The objective of this question is to give practice with writing a function with several arguments and creating local objects.

#### (a)

Write a function called `z_prop()` which calculates the $z$-statistic given the following values/arguments:

> `x`:  the number of successes  
> `n`:  the number of trials  
> `p0`: the hypothesized population proportion

*Hint*: As a reminder, the $z$-statistic is given by the formula
\begin{align*}
z &= \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{p_0\left(1 - p_0\right)}{n}}},
\end{align*}
where $\hat{p}$ denotes the sample proportion. How is $\hat{p}$ related to the input arguments?

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

#### (b)

Suppose that 60% of residents in the city of Pawnee, Indiana, prefer waffles over pancakes. Out of a sample of 13 Pawnee residents, 10 of them prefer waffles. Use your `z_prop()` function from (a) to calculate the $z$-statistic for this sample.

*Hint*: The input argument `p0` is a proportion, *not* a percentage.

```{r}

```

#### (c)

Interpret the value of the $z$-statistic from (b) in the context of the data.

*Hint*: This is a Stats 10/12/13 question.

#### (d)

For the same population of Pawnee residents, another sample is observed. Out of a sample of 39 Pawnee residents, 30 of them prefer waffles. Use your `z_prop()` function from (a) to calculate the $z$-statistic for this sample. How/Why has your $z$-statistic changed?




## Intermediate Questions

**Collaboration on intermediate questions must adhere to \textcolor{red}{Level 1} collaboration described in the Stats 20 Collaboration Policy.**

### Question 6

The objective of this question is to give further practice with writing a function with several arguments and following instructions given in pseudocode.

Read through the following pseudocode and answer the following questions:
```
FUNCTION: lease_calc
INPUTS: msrp : the manufacturer's suggested retail price.
        price: the sale price of the car in dollars.  
        down:  the amount of the down payment on the car in dollars.
        n:     the duration of the lease in months
               default = 36.  
        res:   the residual percentage, what the expected value of the car at the end of 
               the lease relative to its price, a percentage represented in decimal form
               default = 0.60.  
        mf:    the "money factor" of the lease, essentially a finance charge
               default = 0.001.  
        tax:   the local sales tax rate as a decimal
               default = 0.095.
OUTPUT: The monthly lease payment on a new car.

capitalized cost        <- sale price of the car - down payment
residual value          <- manufacturer's suggested retail price * residual percentage
monthly depreciation    <- difference of capitalized cost and residual value then 
                           divided by the number of months
monthly finance charge  <- capitalized cost plus residual value then multiplied
                           by the money factor
sub-total               <- monthly depreciation + monthly finance charge
total                   <- sub-total plus taxes
RETURN total
```

#### (a)

Based on the above pseudocode, write a function called `lease_calc()` to calculate the monthly lease payment on a new car.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

#### (b)

Use your `lease_calc()` function from (a) to calculate the monthly lease payment on a car with an MSRP of \$31,495 sold for \$29,895, with a \$2,500 down payment, over 36 months, with a residual percentage of 52\%, at a money factor of 0.0016, in Los Angeles where the local sales tax is 9.5\%.

```{r}

```

### Question 7

The objective of this question is to give practice with breaking up a problem into steps and encapsulating the algorithm into a function.

For this question, we will refer to U.S. coins of denominations 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents, respectively called pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.

#### (a)

Without using R, what is the minimum number of coins required to equal 47 cents? Explain your reasoning.

<!-- Answer below -->


#### (b)

We want to formalize and generalize the logic you used in (a). For an arbitrary number of cents, outline or describe the steps you would take to find the minimum number of coins required to equal that number of cents.

<!-- Answer below -->


#### (c)

Using your outline from (b), write a function called `get_minimum_coins()` which inputs a positive (whole) number of cents (call the argument `cents`) and outputs the minimum number of coins required to equal that number of cents.


```{r}

```

#### (d)

Test your `get_minimum_coins()` function from (c) with the following inputs:  

(i) 21 cents
```{r}

```

(ii) 38 cents
```{r}

```

(iii) 119 cents
```{r}

```

#### (e)

Use and explain your reasoning to find the number of cents less than 100 which requires the most coins. Verify your answer with your `get_minimum_coins()` function from (c).
<!-- Answer below -->



### Question 8

The objective of this question is to help you learn about the scope of global and local objects, the logic of functions, and the concept of masking.

Consider the following code:

```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 4

exp1 <- function() {
  x^y
}

exp2 <- function(x = 2) {
  x^y
}

exp_y <- function(x) {
  function(y) {
    x^y
  }
}
```


#### (a)

Why does the command `exp1()` give a different answer than `exp2()`?
<!-- Answer below -->

#### (b)

Why does the command `exp_y()` *not* throw an error? Explain in detail what is happening.
<!-- Answer below -->


#### (c)

Without redefining the global objects `x` or `y`, changing the definition of the `exp_y()` function, or creating any new objects, use the `exp_y()` function to calculate the fifteenth power of three.
<!-- Answer below -->
